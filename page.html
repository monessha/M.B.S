        Welcome player, together we are going to learn about the unspoken history behind us vampires. 
        The first vampire Callum, the father for all vampires originated from the curse upon the Great Witch of White.
         Ever since then, the remarkable creation of our species was created. The white witch had cursed our kind to feed off the human blood yet gifted us with talents no species possess. 
         Whether it be our agile speed, vision or our ability to read minds creates us to be the strongest creatures to exist. 
         However, the long-line of mutts or as they call themselves the werewolves are often causing dispute with us. We need to show them who we are and thus the worthy one to rule over this human race. 
         Remember player, you are hand in hands with the most powerful creature on this planet. The recent death of our kind Isabelle, a young vamp with a fresh future ahead had been murdered brutally by these mutts. 
         We need your help to take action on this issue.
