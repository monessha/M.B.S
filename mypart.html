        We need your help to take action on this issue. Callum was devastated to lose a vampire from his army, he was furious as he knew who could be behind Isabelle's death. 
        The Wolves! was eventually his thought however the way they killed her was a different pattern to the usual. Could it be outsiders? Who could this even be? 
        He immediately gathered his family for a discussion to take on a revenge on this unknown person but perhaps wanted to confirm if it really wasn't wolves job.
        Violet, Callum's daughter immediately ran to get wolvesvain and hunt for a wolve who can reveal the truth. After a long day, Violet found a man by the woods, she introduced herself to Archer, a hunky, attractive man.
        He was searching for a nearby place to drink water, Violet gave him a water bottle filled with wolvesvain, as he consumed, it burnt his throat. She immediately rushed and tied him up with rope and took him back to the meeting area.
